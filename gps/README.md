# The Badger Positioning System!

Displays the Badger's location in time and space, along with the friendly face of the Badger himself.  Works with the Badger2040 and PA1010 GPS module from Pimoroni.

Copy the python files and badger_crop.bin on to your Badger with Thonny, connect the GPS module to the Badger's qwiic port, then run gps.py.

On first start it may take a long time (several minutes) to acquire signal.  This is normal.

pa1010.py is designed to be easily reusable - look in the code for documentation.
